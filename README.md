# snake_game_assembly_8086_MASM 
Snake game that is able to run on DOSBox. All of the code is written with assembly MASM 8086.

I would like to hear suggestions for how to improve the game, and your overall opinion about it.

Instructions:

1.If you cross the up and down boundaries, you lose!(I'm working on code that will move the snake to the opposite side of the screen) 

2.Use the arrows keys to take turns.

3.To exit press Esc

4.To win, gain FFh points(make the score register to overflow).

5.If you lose, press space to start over or any other key to quit.
